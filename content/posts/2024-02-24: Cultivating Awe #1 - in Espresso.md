Michael Gervais in his excellent podcast "Finding Mastery" mentioned at some points that he assessed his days by actively counting the times he was in awe.

This morning, I was reminded when I sipped the first Espresso of the day. Freshly ground, freshly pulled.

Someone, somewhere in Ethiopia took care of a coffee plant well and long enough for it to bear fruit, and it was then harvested. Brough to Europe. Roasted and packaged.

Someone, somewhere built the grinder and Espresso machine out of components, built out of materials that ultimately had been dug out of Earth at some point in time. 

Electricity and infrastructure that enables me to sit at my desk, after having come from the kitchen where grinder and machine are placed. 

All the actions, material manipulations, distances to be bridged. 

And so many more aspects that I have omitted. 

What a marvel.
