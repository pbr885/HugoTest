Something that occurred to me today when I for the first time learned about Cloudflare's serverless offerings, Hugo and Git. I admit that I'm way behind the curve for all of those things, but in my career or life so far it had never come up. 

Back in high school creating a homepage meant HTML and FTP uploads, and that was it for me then. More recently, I wrangled a functioning site out of a hosted WordPress.

Today, with some help of RaycastAI (and significant guidance from [Ben](https://ben.wf/), who nudged me to even start this endeavor), I managed to set up Hugo, set up Github, set up Cloudflare, and managed to make sense of error messages I received due to wrong info in configuration files or changed processes.

Now, in no way is the result perfect, but I was astonished by how smoothly it all went. I started out with some guide websites, as I would have done pre-GenAI, but I was able to deal with anything thrown at me that would have led to more frustrated googling in the past, as those things weren't covered in the guide. Now, even taking into account that googles results are better for error messages than they are for more general queries, it would've been frustrating.

And it got me thinking about the four quadrants of learning: 
1) unconcious incompetence
2) conscious incompetence
3) conscious competence
4) unconscious competence

While there are projects that will make GenAI a useful tool for actual learning (in the form of tutoring for closed knowledge systems, such as school or defined subjects), on a more abstract level it seems like GenAI is able to massively reduce the time to a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) by enabling a massive leap once the border into conscious incompetence has been crossed. 

As soon as you know what you need to do on a very abstract level ("I know that I don't know how to set up Hugo") GenAI presents the interface to receiving concrete answers to my questions, instead of me continuing to have the burden of sifting through Google search results without knowing if the result will even contain the answer.

Now, this doesn't take away from any of the obvious caveats: 
Yes, GenAI is a stochastic parrot.
Yes, it may very well be that there would have been more elegant or efficient solutions.
Yes, I only understand what I did on a superficial level. 
But it works* 

For me, it was about a blog, or about a very simple personal website. But I have to admit, it left a lasting impression.
