"Conservatism" has been hijacked by contemporary political language. It has come to mean trying to maintain things as they're perceived to have been, but actually never were. 

Firstly, because any memory is an active act, not a mere exact recollection of anything. Secondly, because the individual lens would never be able to compare the current situation (viewed through the individual lens) against a complete snaphot of "what was".

The Queen was on to something[2]. To conserve things, we have to do "all the running". It would seem already then, that conservatism has quite the active, I dare not say progressive quality to it.

And cybernetics? Well. I find it to be a sensible approach to navigating. I will have some catching up to do with the literature. Eventually some Beer, but more immediately Lassl with his three volumes of "The Viability of Organizations" and Rüegg-Sturm and Grand with their St. Galler Management-Modell.

[1] Carroll, Lewis: Through the Looking-Glass and what Alice Found There, Chapter 2.
[2] With her introductory remark, that is. The assessment of her "Off with their heads!" approach to governance I'll save for another post.
