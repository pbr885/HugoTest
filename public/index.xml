      <description>Michael Gervais in his excellent podcast &amp;ldquo;Finding Mastery&amp;rdquo; mentioned at some points that he assessed his days by actively counting the times he was in awe.
This morning, I was reminded when I sipped the first Espresso of the day. Freshly ground, freshly pulled.

      <description>Something that occurred to me today when I for the first time learned about Cloudflare&amp;rsquo;s serverless offerings, Hugo and Git. I admit that I&amp;rsquo;m way behind the curve for all of those things, but in my career or life so far it had never come up.
Back in high school creating a homepage meant HTML and FTP uploads, and that was it for me then. More recently, I wrangled a functioning site out of a hosted WordPress.</description>
